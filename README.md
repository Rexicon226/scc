# Sinon's C Compiler

A very experiment C compiler that currently only emits ASM.
The goal is to have something *barely* useable. 

Heavily inspired from https://github.com/rui314/chibicc, the parser code is genius.

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Zero-arity Functions
- [ ] Pointer Arthemtics
- [x] Pointers
- [x] While Statement
- [x] For Statement
- [x] Blocks `{ ... }`
- [x] If Statement
- [x] Multi Character Variables
- [x] Returns
- [x] Null Statement
- [x] Equalities `<= != ==`
- [x] Unaries
